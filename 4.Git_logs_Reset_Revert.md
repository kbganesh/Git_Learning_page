# Git Reset:

It helps change the previous position,  Which means reset or change the head Position. Reset has two types one is soft and another one is hard. When we run the command we should use the --hard but soft no need mention --soft, it takes by default.

Take a backup before perform the activity. ```cp -rf busapp busapp.org```

```
git reset --hard <commit id>
git reset <commit id>
```
--hard command changes the head positition and also remove the files also. but soft keep the files in the working directory doesn't delete.

# Git Revert:

It helps to remove the particular commit. After commits and Previous commits in same state.

```
git revert <commit id>
```

Note: In the above commands file1 only reverted to old stage and other files still present in same place. And also it asks a prompt to confirm because it is going to delete a commit.

When we use --no-commit in the revert command, It doesn't asks a prompt because we used a option --no commit.

```
git revert <commit-id> --no-commit
```
