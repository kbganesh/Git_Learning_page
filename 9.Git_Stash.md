# Git Stash:

If we are working in a project already done half project but not committed to local repo, But manager told you to commit some files urgently into local repo, During the time it will useful.We can hide the files which worked earlier and commit the files which manager requested.

Steps:

```
mkdir stashpractise
git init statshpractise
cd stashpractise
touch 1 2
git add . ( Now manager added some files in same folder and told me to commit so I want to hide the 1 & 2)
git stash ( This command hides the files)
touch 3
git add .
git commit -m 'Testing'
git stash list
touch 4
git add .
git stash ( So two times stash was done)
git stash list
git stash pop ( It used to release the hided stash into the folder)
git commit -m 'Hello'
git stash pop 0 ( Used to to release the particular stash, We can the stash number in git stash list)
git commit -m 'Hello 2'
```
