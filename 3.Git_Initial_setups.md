# GIT Initialization(Adding Folder into GIT):

```
mkdir /busapp
cd /busapp
touch file1 file2
cd ..
git init busapp
```

Busapp is our project and git init busapp command used to get in the busapp folder into the VCS(version control system)

If we ran the command it creates a .git dir inside the busapp.

# Move Files from Working Dir to Staging:

```
git add .
```
The following command used to get in the particular files from working directory to staging area: 

```
git add file1 
```
(Here file1 only goes from Working directory to staging area)

# Check the status:

The below command gives all front end and back end commands & it lists untrack files too ( Which means some files not added into staging)

```
git status
```

# To revert the file from staging to Working directory :

```
git rm --cached file1
```

Note :If you run the "git sttaus" command it doesn't shows any untrack files.Because We reverted the file from Saging to Working directory.
