# Git Rebase:

Rebase is the concept of combining sequence of commits. It differs with the merge concept because merge is a copy of a branch but in rebase we are combining sequence of commit. It is alternative for merge command.

We have a master branch with all our codes but unfortunately user creates an another branch called feature and did two commits and another user did two commits in same master branch. So now wewants to rebase the master branch.

```
git checkout -b feature
git branch
touch file4 file5
git add .
git commit -m ‘change1’
touch file6 file7
git add .
git commit -m ‘change 2’
git checkout master
git status
touch selva kumar
git add .
git commit -m ‘Master1’
touch rahul dravid
git add .
git commit -m ‘master2’
git rebase feature master
```
