Using the highlighted URL, Go to the Remote repository in the remote repository page, We can see the error in pull request page, So we can fix that using browser itself or command line also.

All commands will get from browser itself.

Again just pull using the command :  git pull origin master ( It shows what are files conflicted)

And fix the changes and push it remote repo again.
