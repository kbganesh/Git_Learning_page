During the clone time it doesn’t ask any password for our repo because it is a public repository anyone can download and use it.

After clone the repository we need to add some files and then going to update our remote repository.

Update the remote Repo: To update the remote repository we require the access token, So we need create a token from github site, GO to the profile, Developer setting and Generate an access token and use it.

Command to update the remote Repo:

```
git push origin master
```

Command to update local repo from remote Repo:

```
git pull -r
```

To find out the Remote Repo details:

Some of companies or production environment managing two Repo’s one is for live, So users are fetch the data from live repo after complete the work, They upload the files into another repo(Which mean they push the files into another repo during the time, We need to change the push origin )

Command to set the remote repository push origin:

```
git remote set-url --push origin <URL>
```

To change the remote repo,Just use command only no need mention the --push : 

```
git remote set-url origin <URL>
```

# How to move local Repo to Remote Repo(Github):

Step 1:

Create a dir in your local machine and commit some files: "mkdir git-pc" "cd git-pc" "touch 1 2 3"   "git init ."  "git add 1 2 3" "git commit -m “New file"

Step 2: 

Create a Repo in github page, During the creation time, Do not select the option readme those steps because we are going push the existing local repo.

Step 3: 

"git remote add origin <URL>"( Which created in github) Check the branch using the command: "git branch" (If it is a master means leave it, Other than the master please change it use the command) "git branch -M master" "git push -u origin master" (To push our codes)
